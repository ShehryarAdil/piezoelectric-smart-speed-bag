Hardware & Schematics (hardware)

This folder contains the circuit diagrams and design layouts for the project's internal and external components.

Internal Circuitry:
The core circuit includes:

Four parallel-connected piezoelectric sensors for energy harvesting.

A bridge rectifier to convert AC voltage from the sensors to DC.

A voltage regulator to provide a stable 5V DC supply for the microcontroller and Bluetooth module.

An Esp-32 and an operational amplifier (op-amp) for signal processing.

External Design:
The design includes a durable foam layer to protect the sensors from high-force impacts. The sensors are placed in a circle to ensure accurate hit detection regardless of the impact angle.
